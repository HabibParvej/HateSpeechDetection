# Hate Speech Detection

This project aims to detect hate speech in social media posts using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of text messages, labeled as either hate speech or non-hate speech, to classify content and identify potentially harmful language.

## Project Overview

Social media platforms are increasingly used for communication but are also sometimes misused to spread hate speech. This project addresses that issue by developing a machine learning model that can help identify hate speech in text data.

### Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares text data for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Uses techniques like tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and other text processing methods to extract meaningful features.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trains a classification model and evaluates its accuracy in detecting hate speech.
